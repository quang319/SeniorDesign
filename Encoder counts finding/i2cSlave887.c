 *			Revised by Quang 10/9/2013
 *  This libary is for setting up and using the PIC I2C protocol
 *	The 2 main functions in this libary are
 *	 	
 *.		1. i2cInit(char address)
 * 			This function just setup the bits needed to run I2C
 *			*NOTE* You still need to turnon PEIE and I2C bit of PIE1
 *
 *		2. i2cIsrHandler()
 *			This is function is handle everything else for the I2C.		
 *		
 *			To receive data from master, the master should send 3 bytes of data.
 *			The last 2 bytes will be stored in i2cSpeed and i2cDirrection.
 *			
 *			To send data to master, the master should request 2 bytes of data.
 *			COUNTS will be the data that will be sent to the master. It is up 
 *			to the master to piece 2 bytes back to 1 interger.
 *
 * Timing infomation:
 *	  It takes roughly 400 us to read from master or write to master. 
 *			This timing is for the entire operation, not just timing for sending
 *			or receiving just one byte of data.
